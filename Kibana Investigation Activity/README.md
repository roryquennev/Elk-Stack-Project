## Kibana Investigation

#### SSH Barrage

Task: Generate a high amount of failed SSH login attempts and verify that Kibana is picking up this activity.

<details>
<summary> Activity File: SSH Barrage </summary>

#### Scenario

- You are a cloud architect that has been tasked with setting up an ELK server to gather logs for the Incident Response team to use for training.

- Before you hand over the server to the IR team, your senior architect has asked you to verify the ELK server is working as expected and pulling both logs and metrics from the pentesting web servers.

**Your Task**: Generate a high amount of failed SSH login attempts and verify that Kibana is picking up this activity.

---

We can easily do this by trying to SSH to a web machine from our jump box directly without using the Ansible container. 

1. Start by logging into your jump-box. 

2.  Run the failed SSH command in a loop to generate failed login log entries.
        
        - while :; do ssh -T ansible@10.0.0.5; done

3. Search through the logs in Kibana to locate your generated failed login attempts.

**Bonus**: Create a nested loop that generates SSH login attempts across all three of your VM's:
        
        - while :; do ssh -T ansible@10.0.0.5 | ssh -T ansible@10.0.0.6 | ssh -T ansible@10.0.0.10; done

#### Linux Stress

Task: Generate a high amount of CPU usage on the pentesting machines and verify that Kibana picks up this data.

<details>

<summary> Activity File: Linux Stress </summary>


#### Scenario

- You are a cloud architect that has been tasked with setting up an ELK server to gather logs for the Incident Response team to use for training.

- Before you hand over the server to the IR team, your senior architect has asked that you verify the ELK server is working as expected and pulling both logs and metrics from the pen-testing web servers.


**Your Task**: Generate a high amount of CPU usage on the pentesting machines and verify that Kibana picks up this data.

---

#### Notes

The Metrics page for a single VM shows the CPU usage for that machine. This shows how much work the machine is doing. Excessively high CPU usage is typically a cause for concern, as overworked computers are at greater risk for failure.

- Metricbeat forwards data about CPU load to Elasticsearch, which can be visualized with Kibana.

- In this activity, you will intentionally stress the CPU of one of your VMs, then find evidence of the increased activity in Kibana.

Linux has a common, easy-to-use diagnostic program called `stress`. It is easy to use and can be downloaded via `apt`.

#### Instructions

1. From your jump box, start up your Ansible container and attach to it.

2. SSH from your Ansible container to one of your WebVM's.

3. Run `sudo apt install stress` to install the stress program.

4. Run `sudo stress --cpu 1` and allow `stress` to run for a few minutes. 

5. View the Metrics page for that VM in Kibana.  What indicates that CPU usage increased?

6. Run the `stress` program on all three of your VMs and take screenshots of the data generated on the Metrics page of Kibana.

        - **Note:** The stress program will run until you quit with Ctrl+C.

#### wget-DoS


Task: Generate a high amount of web requests to your pen-testing servers and make sure that Kibana is picking them up.

<details>

<summary> Activity File: wget-DoS </summary>


#### Scenario

- You are a cloud architect that has been tasked with setting up an ELK server to gather logs for the Incident Response team to use for training.

- Before you hand over the server to the IR team, your senior architect has asked that you verify the ELK server is working as expected and pulling both logs and metrics from the pen-testing web servers.

**Your Task**: Generate a high amount of web requests to your pen-testing servers and make sure that Kibana is picking them up.

#### Instructions

The Metrics section for a single VM will show Load and Network Traffic data. 

We can generate abnormal data to view by creating a DoS web attack. The command-line program `wget` can do this easily.

`wget` will download a file from any web server. Use man pages for more info on `wget`.

1. Log into your jump box.

2. Run `wget ip.of.web.vm`.

        ```bash
        sysadmin@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ wget 10.0.0.5
        --2020-05-08 15:44:00--  http://10.0.0.5/
        Connecting to 10.0.0.5:80... connected.
        HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 302 Found
        Location: login.php [following]
        --2020-05-08 15:44:00--  http://10.0.0.5/login.php
        Reusing existing connection to 10.0.0.5:80.
        HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
        Length: 1523 (1.5K) [text/html]
        Saving to: index.html

        index.html            100%[=======================>]   1.49K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      

        2020-05-08 15:44:00 (179 MB/s) - index.html saved [1523/1523]
        ```

3. Run `ls` to view the file you downloaded from your web VM to your jump box. 

        ```bash
        sysadmin@Jump-Box-Provisioner:~$ ls
        index.html
        ```

4. Run the `wget` command in a loop to generate many web requests.

        - You can use a bash `for` or `while` loop, directly on the command line, just as you did with the SSH command.

5. Open the Metrics page for the web machine you attacked and answer the following questions:
        
        - Which of the VM metrics were affected the most from this traffic?

**Bonus**: Notice that your `wget` loop creates a lot of duplicate files on your jump box.

-  Write a command to delete _all_ of these files at once.

-  Find a way to run the `wget` command without generating these extra files.
                
        - Look up the flag options for `wget` and find the flag that lets you choose a location to save the file it downloads. 
                
        - Save that file to the Linux directory known as the "void" or the directory that doesn't save anything.

**Bonus**: Write a nested loop that sends your `wget` command to all three of your web VMs over and over.
